# Factor Quadratic
A simple tool used to factor a quadratic equation by a times c factoring and the quadratic formula.

## Instructions
A) Download Python 3 via [Python 3's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

B) Download `factor-quadratic` as a .zip file.

C) Run `main.py` in `factor-quadratic`. You may create a shortcut if needed.

## Use
You must input a quadratic equation(ax^2+bx+c) specifically. No other equation will work and the program can *only* facotr by a times c factoring. If it cannot, it will run the quadratic formula. This program does not deal with imaginary numbers.
### Input Example
```
x^2+5x+6
-15x^2-x+16
5x^2-26x-15
...
```
